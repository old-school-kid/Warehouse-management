## Problem Statemnt 
A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable raw materials which makes it all, the most important factor for such a company is to accurately forecast daily and weekly demand. Too much inventory in the warehouse means more risk of wastage, and not enough could lead to out-of-stocks - and push customers to seek solutions from your competitors. Further a lacK of communication between supplier, warehouse and client also leads to a wobbly supply chain, aggravating the situation. For food safety purposes a robust tracing technique is also required.
